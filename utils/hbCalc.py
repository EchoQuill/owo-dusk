"""
The approach here is simple (if we count out the coding part).
We are using greedy approach here, invest in the trait with possiblity to level up the highest,
counting out the best solution to invest in duration, cost etc first...
but hey this also works fine, users can disable the trait they dont want to invest in
to prevent the code from investing essense in those.

If in-case essense we have is not enough to level up any traits to next level,
then it will focus on priorities that I have set instead.

Whatever this is:
