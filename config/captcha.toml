#  Hello, Please read everything carefully

# ===============================================

# Two captcha solvers exist in OwO-Dusk.
# Image captcha and Hcaptcha solvers

# Hcaptcha is PAID, as we are using 3rd party solver ->  https://yescaptcha.com/i/MNaKrh
# I don't intend on spending any money for maintaining OwO-Dusk so to the most party
# Hcaptcha solver will be user tested.

# Then we have Image captcha solver, this is entirely FREE.
# There is little to no risk here since solver has a solve rate of 90%.

# Hcaptcha solver is risky, solver is somewhat average..
# Hcaptcha updates frequently so its a pointless battle to fight against
# In my opinion. That said, you can still of your own risk enable the captcha solver
# Through here, but do note few things:

# -- For Hcaptcha -- #

# 1. OwObot logs ip when verifying for captchas, so if any of your alts
#    Get caught your other accounts may be banned as well. I personally reccoment
#    Using vpn or more preferably TOR browser to verify manually instead
# 2. Paid.

# -- For Image captcha -- #
# 1. Free, and all but uses 60~ MB extra storage
# 2. To use this you will need to enable Image Captcha solver and rerun `setup.py`
#    to install the required modules (won't be installed by default..)

# If possible, do keep an eye on for captchas, and don't blindly rely on solvers
