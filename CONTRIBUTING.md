# Contributing Guidelines

Hey there! Thanks for wanting to contribute. Just a few (very chill but important) rules:

- **Please don't give me a heart attack** by stuffing everything into one massive PR.
- **One feature = one pull request**. It‚Äôs easier to review, test, and merge.
- **Major changes? Talk to me first!** Open an issue or discussion before you start so we're on the same page. You may also dm me on `@echoquill` on discord.
- **Keep the code clean** There is currently no specific formatting used for the code, but make it as clean, short and neat as possible. Try your best to keep variable, function names simple!


## üõ†Ô∏è Local Setup

To run the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/echoquill/owo-dusk.git
cd owo-dusk
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
python setup.py
python uwu.py # Enter token etc through setup
```


## ‚úÖ Commit Messages

```
Use clear and simple commit messages like:

- `fix: fixes a bug
- `feat: added a feature`
- `refactor: cleanup code`

just make it understandable!
```
