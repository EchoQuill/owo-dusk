# Contributing Guidelines

Hey there, Thanks for wanting to contribute! OwO-Dusk being an open source and free project, we welcome any PR.
Just a few things:

1) Keep one Pull Request for one feature, Don't put everything into one PR.
2) If major changes please contact me through discord - @echoquill
3) For commit messages put `feat` `chore` `refactor` `fix` etc as required

That should mostly be it. I would also appriciate it if you check whether `beta` branch is more updated than `main` and making the PR there instead. This is not required but will help me lots!
(If bug fixes feel free to use `main` branch!)

Thanks again :>
