# Contributing Guidelines

Hey there! Thanks for wanting to contribute. Just a few (very chill but important) rules:

- **Please don't give me a heart attack** by stuffing everything into one massive PR.
- **One feature = one pull request**. It‚Äôs easier to review, test, and merge.
- **Major changes? Talk to me first!** Open an issue or discussion before you start so we're on the same page. You may also dm me on `@echoquill` on discord.


## üõ†Ô∏è Local Setup

## ‚úÖ Commit Messages

```
Use clear and simple commit messages like:

just make it understandable!
```
